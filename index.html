                <section>What is Land Use Management? </section>
                <section>Land use management is the art of managing, directing, administrating, regulating and
                    controlling the use of land by government for sustainable urban development.
                </section>
                <section>Land-use management can also be defined as the process of regulating the use of land by a
                    central authority. Usually, this is done in an effort to promote a more desirable social and
                    environmental outcomes as well as a more efficient use of resources.

                    -As a result of the growth spurt in China as well as the challenges that came with it in the 1990s,
                    the chinese government came up with strict policies to guide and manage the use of land. One of

                        settlements into modern, concentrated communities, while converting their former homestead land
                        into farmland.

                                Compulsory land acquisition is the right and action of government to take property not

                                A Transferable Development program (TDR) is a market based solution that provides for
                                development rights to be exchanged between wllling sellers and buyers in a free-market
                                system. A TDR program provides a new planning instrument that redirects development
                                rather than simply prohibiting development.

                            Formal land use planning and management practices in Nigeria began in 1863 with the
                            enactment of the Town Improvement Ordinance by the colonial government. This was to control
                            development and urban sanitation in Lagos.

                            However, modern planning could be said to begin in the country in 1946 when the Nigerian
                            Town and Country Ordinance was enacted

                                In Nigeria today, one of the approaches that has been adopted to manage the use of land
                                is
                                the preparation of comprehensive broad land use plan, to contol development of a long
                                period
                                of time. However, field investigation by Aribigbola (2006) revealed that most of what
                                was
                                implemented in the land use pan was not implemented.

                                be in sync to the master plan and approved before any development takes place. If the

                                    In January 2018, the UK Government published a 25 year Environmental Plan, which was
                                    meant to improve the way they manage and incentivise land management, including

                                From 2022 onwards, a new environmental land management system will be the cornerstone of
                                the agricultural policy in the UK, It will consist of a new scheme that pays providers
                                for delivering environmentally beneficial outcomes; and will provide support for farmers
                                and land managers as they move towards a more effective application of the ‘polluter
                                pays’ principle. As soon as it’s practical, they propose to maintain a strong regulatory
                                baseline of standards that reflects the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

                                wildlife are properly valued and used to inform decisions on future land management

                        This study has showed us that there are different approaches to manage land use, and each
                        country has its own approach tailored to suit her population, natural habitat and landscape.
                        However, one pattern discovered is that it is very common for a country to have laws in place to
                        protect and guide how land is used.
